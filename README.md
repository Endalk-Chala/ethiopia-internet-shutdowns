# Ethiopia Internet Shutdowns Data Repository 
## Background  
The April 2018 appointment of Abiy Ahmed as Ethiopia’s Prime Minister ushered in a moment of optimism for political reform and digital openness, including promises to lift censorship and end state-imposed internet shutdowns (EBC, 2018; Maasho, 2018). Yet, within months, escalating ethnic tensions and political crises prompted the government to reintroduce shutdowns—from targeted platform blocks around Addis Ababa to nationwide blackouts in the wake of high-profile assassinations (Dahir, 2018; NetBlocks, 2019). The subsequent Tigray War (2020–2022) produced some of Ethiopia’s longest and most far-reaching internet blackouts, and continuing unrest in the Amhara and Oromia regions has further entrenched digital disconnection as a core element of state security policy (AccessNow, 2022; Ayalew, 2020; Haile, 2024).  
These developments reveal a persistent tension between aspirations for democratic reform and the state’s invocation of “digital sovereignty” to justify connectivity restrictions. Against this backdrop, our research investigates how the frequency, scope, and duration of shutdowns have evolved over the past two decades—and how official narratives have shifted in response to changing political and security dynamics.  

## Research Questions  
1. **Trend Evolution:** How have the frequency, geographic coverage, and duration of internet shutdowns in Ethiopia changed over the past two decades?  
2. **Narrative Shifts:** How have shifting political conditions and ethnic conflicts influenced government narratives and policy rhetoric legitimizing shutdowns?

## Data & Methodology  
- **Sources:** A comprehensive spreadsheet of NGO trackers, archival reports, and media coverage.  
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Time-series modeling of shutdown events (monthly counts, durations, trend/seasonal decomposition).  
- **Contextual Analysis:** Mapping key official statements onto the quantitative timeline to examine evolving governance rationales.

## Data Availability  
All source documents, the full data-collection spreadsheet, and analysis code are available upon request during blind peer review and will be published in a public GitHub repository upon acceptance.
