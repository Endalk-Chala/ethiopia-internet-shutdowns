# Ethiopia Internet Shutdowns Data Repository

## Introduction  
The appointment of Abiy Ahmed as Ethiopia’s Prime Minister in April 2018 was widely heralded as a turning point for political liberalization, with early commitments to dismantling censorship and end internet shutdowns (Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018; Maasho, 2018). However, within months, escalating ethnic conflicts and political crises led to the reinstatement of shutdowns as a central state tool—from targeted platform restrictions around Addis Ababa to nationwide blackouts following the assassinations of Ethiopia’s Army Chief of Staff in 2019 and musician Hachalu Hundessa in 2020 (Dahir, 2018; NetBlocks, 2019). The Tigray War (2020–2022) produced some of the country’s longest and most extensive blackouts, and recent insurgencies in Amhara and Oromia have further embedded digital disconnection in Ethiopia’s security apparatus (AccessNow, 2022; Ayalew, 2020; Haile, 2024).

## Research Questions  
1. **Trend Evolution:** How have the frequency, geographic coverage, and duration of internet shutdowns in Ethiopia changed over the past two decades?  
2. **Narrative Shifts:** How have shifting political conditions and ethnic conflicts influenced government narratives and policy rhetoric legitimizing shutdowns?

## Data & Methodology  
- **Sources:** A comprehensive spreadsheet of NGO trackers, archival reports, and media coverage.  
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Time-series modeling of shutdown events (monthly counts, durations, trend/seasonal decomposition).  
- **Contextual Analysis:** Mapping key official statements onto the quantitative timeline to examine evolving governance rationales.

## Data Availability  
All source documents, the full data-collection spreadsheet, and analysis code are available upon request during blind peer review and will be published in a public GitHub repository upon acceptance.
